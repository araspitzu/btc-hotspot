## Overview

The application is a hotspot paywall where clients can pay the owner via bitcoin over the lightning network, it's designed
to run on a home server like the raspberry-pi. Clients do not provide personal information neither credit card details, 
they buy a certain "offer" from the paywall which then enables a session for his/her device, offers are made by the owner who can 
define the price and the amount of time or data to be sold to the client.The payment is done using the lightning network
and it enables the client to pay instantly and with minimum transaction fees.
